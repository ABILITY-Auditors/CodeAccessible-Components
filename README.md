# CodeAccessible Repo Guide
## How to Fork, Clone, and Make Pull Requests

### Main Overview 
## Step 1: Fork the Repository.
  Developing a solo project is completely different from collaborating with a team. 
There is a specific workflow one should follow when contributing to a project in Github. 
Forking will create a copy of the project in your own Github account, and it will allow the developers to make changes to the code while ensuring that these changes do not affect the original repository. 
You can do so by clicking the Fork button on the right side of the repo.
