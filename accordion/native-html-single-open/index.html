        <!-- The <details> element has an implicit ROLE of GROUP
             GROUP roles must have an accessible name,
             without one they are not exposed by AT. 
             
             Note: if the GROUP
             obtains its accessible name from the first element inside
             it, most SRs will omit anouncing the name of the group (as
             it is already going to be announced) and simply announced "group"

             When a DETAILS is opened all other DETAILS with the same NAME are
             closed. In this example, all DETAILS have the same NAME, so only
             one can be opened at a time.

                “When King Lear dies in Act V, do you know what Shakespeare has
                written? He’s written “He dies.” That’s all, nothing more. No
                fanfare, no metaphor, no brilliant final words. The culmination of
                the most influential work of dramatic literature is “He dies.” It
                takes Shakespeare, a genius, to come up with “He dies.” And yet
                every time I read those two words, I find myself overwhelmed with
                dysphoria. And I know it’s only natural to be sad, but not because
                of the words “He dies,” but because of the life we saw prior to the
                words. I’ve lived all five of my acts, Mahoney, and I am not asking
                you to be happy that I must go. I’m only asking that you turn the
                page, continue reading… and let the next story begin. And if anyone
                asks what became of me, you relate my life in all its wonder, and
                end it with a simple and modest “He died.”

                and there’s the alter ego. Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
                Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker. When that character wakes up in
                the morning, he’s Peter Parker. He has to put on a costume to become
                Spider-Man. And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone.”
