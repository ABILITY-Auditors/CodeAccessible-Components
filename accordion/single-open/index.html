                    “When King Lear dies in Act V, do you know what Shakespeare has
                    written? He’s written “He dies.” That’s all, nothing more. No
                    fanfare, no metaphor, no brilliant final words. The culmination of
                    the most influential work of dramatic literature is “He dies.” It
                    takes Shakespeare, a genius, to come up with “He dies.” And yet
                    every time I read those two words, I find myself overwhelmed with
                    dysphoria. And I know it’s only natural to be sad, but not because
                    of the words “He dies,” but because of the life we saw prior to the
                    words. I’ve lived all five of my acts, Mahoney, and I am not asking
                    you to be happy that I must go. I’m only asking that you turn the
                    page, continue reading… and let the next story begin. And if anyone
                    asks what became of me, you relate my life in all its wonder, and
                    end it with a simple and modest “He died.”

                    “Now, a staple of the superhero mythology is, there’s the superhero
                    and there’s the alter ego. Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
                    Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker. When that character wakes up in
                    the morning, he’s Peter Parker. He has to put on a costume to become
                    Spider-Man. And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone.”
